\textbf{Assignment Submission } Include a signed agreement to the Honor Code with this assignment. Assignments are due at 11:59pm. All students must submit their homework via Sakai. Students can typeset or scan their homework. Students also need to include their code in the final submission zip file. Put all the code for a single question into a single file. 
\\
\\
\textbf{Late Day Policy } Each student will have a total of {\em two} free late days, and for each homework only one late day can be used. If a late day is used, the due date is 11:59pm on the next day.
\\
\\
\textbf{Honor Code } Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. This is encouraged. However, each student must write down their solutions independently to show they understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themselves.  Students should clearly mention the names of all the other students who were part of their discussion group. Using code or solutions obtained from the web is considered an honor code violation. We check all the submissions for plagiarism. We take the honor code seriously and expect students to do the same.
